# Foot Step Planning Based on A \* algorithm
In this project, we proposed an online footstep planning algorithm for a humanoid robot. The algorithm plans an optimal (and collision free) step sequence for a humanoid robot to walk to the target location. In the below simulation, the red rectangle represents the left foot and the blue represents the right foot.
